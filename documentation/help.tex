\section{Introduction}
The software, Snow Optics Toolbox, discussed in this document was created to allow for the analysis of images for the study of snow optical properties. The information contained in this document is meant to serve two purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item to provide a user manual for operating the software package from within MATLAB and
\item to provide sufficient details for researchers to maintain and modify the software.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Installation}
The Snow Optics toolbox is under development\ldots more to come soon.

\section{Bug Reporting}
The Snow Optics Toolbox is under development, as such problems and bugs are expected. Issues may be reported using the Snow Optics Toolbox \href{https://github.com/aeslaughter/optics/issues}{github}\footnote{\href{https://github.com/aeslaughter/optics}{\nolinkurl{https://github.com/aeslaughter/optics}}} site, please explain the problem in detail. This interface may also be used to make feature suggestions.
